# MyGitProject
Welcome to Hayden and Braden's GitHub Repository

For this collaboration, we used a simple Python program, number_guesser.py, where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number. Each of us contributed to different aspects of the code while using GitHub to manage changes, resolve merge conflicts, and document contributions.
